First of all, i want to say that, if you find or face any problem then please notify me without any hesitation.
In this project have a entry point and a end point. So here entry point is, Main.java and end point is when you want to 
close the application.

Here, only one query is needed, which is an admin. You get the query in src folder, named is essential_query.sql

For Generating report (Sales Report.jrxml and Revenue Report.jrxml), you should put the file into the valid path and used valid path. You also need setup destination path 
for generated report. For generating report without error, you need to add these jars in your project classpath.
1, commons-beanutils-5.1.21.jar. 2, commons-collections-3.2.1.jar. 3, commons-digester-2.1.jar. 4, commons-logging-1.1.jar
5, groovy-all-2.0.1.jar. 6, iText-2.1.7.jar (For pdf). 7, itextpdf-5.1.0.jar. 8. itext-pdfa-5.4.0.jar
9, jasperreports-5.6.0.jar

If you don't know how to add jar into classpath, right click on the jar -> Build Path -> Add to build path.
Or right click on your project, properties -> Java Build Path -> Library -> Add external jar.

I also write to create all table code for mysql. For this, you should install one of the mysql server 5.5 to 5.7 version.

Any where in the project, if you don't understand the code, please knock me in facebook message or what's app message.
